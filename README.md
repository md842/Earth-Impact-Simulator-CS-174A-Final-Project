# Earth Impact Simulator (UCLA Fall 2023 CS 174A Final Project)
This repository contains a JavaScript webpage that simulates an impact of a user-customizable meteor on Earth using the Tiny Graphics library. By altering the initial parameters set for the meteor's size and speed, the user can control the output of the simulation; the Earth's state post-collision ranges from unaffected to completely fragmented. Other features, such as changes to the meteor's texture, the selected camera view, the "Play Music" button, etc. do not affect the physics of the simulation.

This is a group final project for the Fall 2023 session of CS 174A (Introduction to Computer Graphics) at UCLA.
