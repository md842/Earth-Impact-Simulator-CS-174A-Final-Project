# Earth Impact Simulator (UCLA Fall 2023 CS 174A Final Project)
This repository contains a JavaScript webpage that simulates an impact of a user-customizable projectile on Earth using the Tiny Graphics library.

This is a group final project for the Fall 2023 session of CS 174A (Introduction to Computer Graphics) at UCLA.

2) Run `host.bat`.
3) Open your web browser of choice and navigate to
